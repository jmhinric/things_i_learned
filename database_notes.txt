# Notes:

## user/roles:
list all roles:
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_user;

psql
\du
same as:

SELECT
  u.usename AS "Role name",
  CASE
  WHEN u.usesuper AND u.usecreatedb THEN CAST('superuser, create database' AS pg_catalog.text)
  WHEN u.usesuper THEN CAST('superuser' AS pg_catalog.text)
  WHEN u.usecreatedb THEN CAST('create database' AS pg_catalog.text)
  ELSE CAST('' AS pg_catalog.text)
  END AS "Attributes"
FROM pg_catalog.pg_user u
ORDER BY 1
;

To toggle whether the database requires a password: change between `md5` and `trust` in this file:
/usr/local/var/postgres/pg_hba.conf

To reset a user's password:

To create a user with read permissions:
CREATE USER guest WITH PASSWORD 'testpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO myuser;
OR readonly:
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO myuser;

analyze
vaccuum process
query plan
database statistic
dirtied- updates, inserts, deletes

transaction isolation

stats table:
used by the query plan to figure out which query strategy to use.  If there are more than x rows, read one certain way.  Else, read a different way.
If the stats are off, an inefficient plan may be used.
When database is made in initial environment, analyze hasn't been run, so query plans are off.  Within a transaction, analyze never gets a chance to run, which is why the second time through it's much faster.

Transaction isolation causes many virtual rows to possibly be made, until a certain threshold is reached where vacuum is kicked off to clean up those unused rows. If too many virtual rows get built up, the analyze plan can get thrown off resulting in inefficient queries.

MVCC- multi version concurrency controls

when pg_dump, pg_restore is used:
all inserts are made, then db is immediately shut down.  Analyze doesn't run, so stats don't get updated.

micro-service architecture- circuit breaker pattern

yum package manager for AWS web app
RPM- redhat package manager- installing binary- binary, pre and post install
yum- package repo for RPMs to install things easily
  yum search httpd
  yum info httpd
  yum install httpd
httpd is apache web server
yum install nmap
yum also does dependency management

package_all.sh - Basis
fpm- fucking package manager
ssh tunnel to be able to view the web page with private IP address





Networking:
TCP/IP book from Jeff Smith

IP Addresses:
10.1.15.5
10.1.15 is the Network,
5 is the host
- together the whole number is the network
- 32 bits (4 numbers, each 0-255)
- /24 or /16 - CIDR notation
- 255.255.255.0 is the default subnet mask
- host has 254 choices
  - 0 is reserved to denote the network itself
  - 255 is reserved as a broadcast address to do tasks associated with things like querying hosts

- DHCP server is dynamic host configuration protocol
  - server that assigns you an IP address on a network
  - IP addresses can expire or have a limited number available

- DNS server translates URL to IP address
  - linux commands:
    - `ifconfig`: inet shows your IP
    - `dig`:
      - `dig www.amazon.com ANY` - gives CNAME
      - `dig www.cdn.amazon.com A` - gives A record
        - A Records are the most basic type of DNS record and are used to point a domain or subdomain to an IP address. Assigning a value to an A record is as simple as providing your DNS management panel with an IP address to where the domain or subdomain should point and a TTL
      - `dig www.cdn.amazon.com NS` - give nameserver for ww.cdn.amazon.com
    - cat /etc/resolv.conf
    - netstat -nr
      - gives routing tables


- A default gateway serves as an access point or IP router that a networked computer uses to send information to a computer in another network or the internet. Default simply means that this gateway is used by default, unless an application specifies another gateway.
